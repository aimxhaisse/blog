## Features

- fullscreen support,
- audio support,
- mobile-friendly.

## Usage

This is highly customized for my use, but can be forked & adapted
provided some knownledge of Hugo.

## Images

Ideal export settings:

- 1600px on the long side
- jpeg quality

Other formats are supported but this seems to work well on all devices
and the trade-off between image size and quality looks appropriate for
a photography oriented portfolio.
