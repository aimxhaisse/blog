title: About Net Neutrality
---

I've been writing [a short response](/net_neutrality.pdf) to
the questionnaire on Net neutrality issued by the European
Commission. I only tried to answer a few questions as I hadn't much
time, and as I was not able to formulate real answers to others
questions. I guess part of this is out of topic but I'm ok with it. My
answer is based on personal experiences with the filtering of port 25
and Orange, but I think DPI would have been a better topic.
