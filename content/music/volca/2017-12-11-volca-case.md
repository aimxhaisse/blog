title: Pencil case for Volcas
---

[Someone on
Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/volcas/comments/4x0e07/i_happened_upon_the_perfect_volca_case/)
found pencil cases matching the size of Volcas, it's a rather cheap
solution compared to the 'official' cases you can find around.

There are two flavors of those cases with slightly different
dimensions, only the key-lock version is suitable: the pad-lock
version is a bit thicker, but there's some inner space dedicated to
the lock which make it hard to fit a Volca (I've tried and failed).

Here are some pictures of what it looks like:
