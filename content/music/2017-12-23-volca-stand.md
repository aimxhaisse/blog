title: DIY Volca stand

Provided time and tools, there are [neat
guides](https://www.reddit.com/r/synthesizers/comments/3zzwnu/made_a_2_volca_stand_for_my_first_woodworking/)
around to make Volca stands, I've followed one of them and made the
following (with help to avoid losing fingers):

Some random tips I learned in the process:

- use massif wood (it's harder to work with but nicer),
- once cut, correct imperfection with wood paste,
- sand down all edges with a medium sandpaper like 80,
- drill with a small borer before screwing, it's easier and prevents
  mishaps: directly screwing induces more vibrations and constraints,
  it increases the chances of breaking the piece (I broke multiple
  ones!),
- add multiple layers of lasure, beware it has some thickness and play
  with it so that you get an inner width that perfectly fits the
  Volca.
